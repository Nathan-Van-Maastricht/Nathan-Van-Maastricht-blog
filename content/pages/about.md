I'm currently a data scientist who works on AI and metaheuristic approaches to solving combinatorial optimisation problems with a focus on applying them to actual business cases. This can involve anything from fundamental research all the way out to deployment.

I have a background in academia, prefering teaching undergraduate courses to doing research. I got my first taste for working in industry with collaborations while in academia. I have lectured mathematical modelling and algorithm analysis courses in the past.

I also have an interest in food and worked in casual fine dining for two years between my academic life and my industry life. In particular I enjoy making focaccia and ramen, and I am currently in the process of working on making baguettes.
