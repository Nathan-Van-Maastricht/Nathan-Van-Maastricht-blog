Over the past few weeks I have been toying with the idea of writing a more technical focused blog for a variety of reasons.

1. As I advance through my career I regularly hit a wall where I believe I have knowledge that is useful to solving business problems, but I have only a small amount of public facing work to demonstrate my skills
2. Maybe I have a small amount of knowledge I can share with the world
3. I miss writing about technical work, even if it is at a high level
4. I enjoy writing in general, this is a good excuse to continue practicing it

Over time, one of the outcomes of this blog that I would like to see is people realising that I can help in solving their business problems, potentially even landing a job I find both fun and intellectually challenging.

Another outcome I want to see is an improvement in my writing. Over the past year I have been focusing on written communication - especially as it relates to business interactions - and the more I receive emails that are clearly generated by the senders favourite LLM, the more I want to practice writing for myself.

So a little bit about me:

- I have a background in mathematics and computer science within academia and industry collaborations while I was in academia, and while I do not posses a PhD, I have lectured courses in mathematical modelling and algorithm analysis
- I am currently employed as a data scientist with a focus on solving real world combinatorial problems using techniques across the AI world, metaheuristic world, and plain old heuristics
- I also worked for two years in fine dining and still enjoy cooking. Cooking and the world of mathematics and computer science has far more overlap than I suspect the average person in either of the disciplines thinks they have, so maybe I will write a food blog on occasion too

I loosely know what type of content I want to write about and they broadly cover three topics:

1. Technical - which will include topics such as AI/ML, mathematics, and algorithms
2. Soft - which like this post are more my thoughts on life or more personal
3. Other - which can be a catch all at this point for topics that do not fit in the technical fields, or the softer skills fields

I will endevour to write a post at least once a week at this point. As I progress on this journey I will reevaluate the cadence of writing to see if I can write more, or should cut back and write less.
